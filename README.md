# Pre-work-in-java

**getting accustomed to this great programming language whose application fields range from understanding basic concepts of OOP to developing complex apps.**


*Java is a statically typed language, i.e., every variable must be declared with a data type. A variable cannot start off life without knowing the range of values it can hold, and once it is declared, the data type of the variable cannot change.(it is strongly typed).*

## Static initializer block in Java


*accessed only once:  **the first time you make an object of that class** or **the first time you access a static member of that class** (even if you never make an object of that class)*

Static initializer blocks are different from initializer blocks.![Check here](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/g-fact-26-the-initializer-block-in-java/). Initializer blocks are executed before constructors and so are Static initializer blocks.
